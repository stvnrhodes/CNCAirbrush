title: Testing... What is this?
author: Marc Russell

Since our machine is up and running, we have been spending most of our time now-a-days testing the system and working out the kinks. This is the first major project I have done as an undergraduate where I have had significant time to perform any testing. While this is kind of weirding me out it's also super nice. Check out the picture of a the F-35C JSF I printed onto a t-shirt this afternoon.

Also, we recently got an exciting sponsorship from the guy's and gal's at [Badger Air-Brush](http://www.badgerairbrush.com/). They are setting us up with awesome painting supplies and equipment which will allow us to make even better looking products!!! The new supplies will hopefully help us deal with some paint clogging issues so we can make more consistent and sharper designs.
