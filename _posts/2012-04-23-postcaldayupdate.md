title: Post Cal Day Update

So we did successfully demo our project at Cal Day. However we weren't able to paint anything due to an issue with the solenoid valve that we had mounted. The valve that we were using had no way to vent to atmosphere. So, when we tried to paint, instead of getting discrete puffs of air, we got a stream of air that trailed off after the valve closed. This prevented us from being able to paint individual pixels.

However, we got everything else working. We finished the software (other than a few tweaks that were required to calibrate the airbrush for painting). The result was awesome! You can see videos in the video section of the website, but essentially we demonstrated that we could keep the tip of the airbrush a constant distance away from an arbitrarily oriented plane while simulating painting an image on it by scanning back and forth over the surface.

We have since fixed our solenoid issue and have successfully painted the script Cal logo in a couple different sizes. You can see pictures of this over in our [gallery](/gallery).
