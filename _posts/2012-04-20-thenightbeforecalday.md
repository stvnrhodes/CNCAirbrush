title: The Night Before Cal Day
author: Marc Russell
---

Tomorrow is Cal Day, and all the good girls and boys(who got into Berkley) are all asleep, eagerly awaiting their chance to tour the greatest campus in the Universe. Of course once they come to Cal, they won't be sleeping so much anymore. They like us will be working hard, late into the the night to finish their projects.

We are showing off our newly assembled machine at Cal Day as part of a Mechanical Engineering project display. Currently Adam and Steven are working hard on getting all the code sorted out. The plan is to have it capable of printing "Cal" on a 2D object by tomorrow. This early deadline will keep our machine on track to be fully operation by the project expo. We had some issues with our 2.5 revolution servo and its replacement breaking and have decided to swap them out for a 180 degree servo. This will limit the space we can paint but will make for a more reliable system.

I can't wait to see our machine paint!!!
